Context

This mock meeting represents a stakeholder buy-in discussion with the server team. The purpose of the meeting is to introduce the draft Vulnerability Management Policy, assess the team’s ability to meet remediation timelines, and gather operational feedback. Stakeholder input resulted in adjustments to the policy, including extending the critical vulnerability remediation window from 48 hours to one week to support realistic and collaborative implementation.

Transcript

Policy Lead:
Good morning. How has everything been lately? I know the past few weeks have been busy for everyone.

Server Team Representative:
It has been a bit hectic, but we’re managing. Thanks for checking in. I reviewed the policy draft, and overall it makes sense. However, with our current staffing levels, we’re not able to meet the more aggressive remediation timelines, particularly the 48-hour window for critical vulnerabilities.

Policy Lead:
That’s completely understandable. The timeline is fairly aggressive, especially at the start. One option could be extending the critical remediation window to one week as a compromise. We could still reserve the 48-hour requirement for exceptional cases, such as severe zero-day vulnerabilities.

Server Team Representative:
That sounds reasonable, and we appreciate the flexibility. Would there also be some leeway early on while we adjust to the remediation and patching process, at least for the first few months?

Policy Lead:
Yes, absolutely. Once the policy is finalized, the program will officially begin, but the plan is to allow all departments roughly six months to adapt and become comfortable with the new process.

Server Team Representative:
That seems fair. We’ll do our best to meet the expectations. I appreciate being included in the decision-making process. It helps us feel like we’re contributing to the solution.

Policy Lead:
Of course. This is a shared effort, and we appreciate your cooperation.

Server Team Representative:
Thank you for keeping the meeting brief.

Policy Lead:
Short meetings are always the best.
